In this article, we will review each track on Bon Iver - Bon Iver and the corresponding short film from the deluxe edition. We will also compare the FLAC format to other formats and explain why it is superior for audiophiles. Let's begin!
 
## Perth
 
The opening track of the album is named after the capital city of Western Australia. It features a powerful drum beat, electric guitars, horns, and Vernon's layered vocals. The song is about Vernon's experience of visiting Perth and feeling a connection to the place and its people.
 
The short film for Perth was directed by Isaac Gale and David Jensen. It shows a group of young men in a rural setting, engaging in various activities such as hunting, fishing, swimming, and camping. The film captures the sense of adventure and camaraderie that the song evokes.
 
The FLAC format preserves the dynamic range and clarity of the song, which can be lost in other formats that use compression or lower bitrates. The FLAC format also allows you to hear the subtle details and nuances of the instruments and vocals, which enhance the emotional impact of the song.
 
## Minnesota, WI
 
The second track of the album is a reference to Vernon's home state of Wisconsin and his neighboring state of Minnesota. It features a blend of acoustic and electronic elements, such as banjo, synth bass, auto-tune, and distorted vocals. The song is about Vernon's struggle to find his identity and direction in life.
 
The short film for Minnesota, WI was directed by Andre Durand and Dan Huiting. It shows a man running through a forest, chased by a mysterious figure in a black cloak. The film reflects the theme of escape and pursuit that the song conveys.
 
The FLAC format maintains the balance and contrast between the different sounds and textures of the song, which can be distorted or flattened in other formats that use compression or lower bitrates. The FLAC format also allows you to appreciate the complexity and creativity of the song's production and arrangement, which showcase Vernon's musical vision.
